Your task is to resume work from a previous session note.

Target Note: {{args}}

## Execution Steps

1. **Locate the session note**
   - If a path is provided in 'Target Note' above, use it directly.
   - If 'Target Note' is empty, list all `.md` files in `project-notes/` and select the one with the **latest filename** (chronological order).

2. **Read and parse the note**
   - Read the file and extract: Git Commit, Todo Items, Key Decisions, Completed Work.

3. **Check project changes**
   - Run `git log --oneline <commit-hash>..HEAD` to see changes since the note.
   - Run `git diff --stat <commit-hash>..HEAD` for details if needed.

4. **Analyze Todo Items**
   - For each uncompleted item, assess if it is still valid or affected by recent changes.

5. **Present Context**
   - Display a summary:
     - Continuing from: [filename]
     - Changes since last session: [summary]
     - Completed (by subsequent work): [list]
     - Outstanding Todo Items: [list]

6. **Next Steps**
   - Ask me which task to continue from the outstanding list.
